#Brain Tumor Detection from MRI Images (EfficientNet + Streamlit + Grad-CAM)

This project detects brain tumors from MRI images using a deep learning model. It classifies an MRI image into one of two classes:

#No Tumor

#Tumor

To make the prediction more understandable, the project also includes Explainable AI (XAI) using Grad-CAM, which highlights the image regions that influenced the model’s decision (shown mainly when the prediction is Tumor).
A Streamlit web app is included so users can upload an MRI image and instantly get a result.
