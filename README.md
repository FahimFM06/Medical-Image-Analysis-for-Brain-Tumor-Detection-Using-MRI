# Medical-Image-Analysis-for-Brain-Tumor-Detection-Using-MRI
This project aims to detect brain tumors from MRI images using a deep learning model. The system processes MRI scans and predicts whether a tumor is present, helping demonstrate how artificial intelligence can be applied to medical image classification.
